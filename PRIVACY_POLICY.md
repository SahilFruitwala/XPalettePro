# XPalettePro Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 23, 2026

XPalettePro is designed to run locally in your browser. This extension does not collect or sell personal information.

## What Data Is Collected
- No personal data is collected.
- No browsing history, credentials, DMs, contacts, or analytics events are collected.

## How Data Is Used
- The extension stores one local preference: selected theme ID (`xp_theme`).
- This value is stored in `chrome.storage.local`.

## Permissions
- `storage`: required to persist selected theme.
- X/Twitter host permissions: required to apply styling only on supported domains.

## Network Access
- No extension telemetry or external API calls are made for theming behavior.
- Normal site requests made by X/Twitter still occur in the browser as usual.

## Data Sharing
- No personal data is shared with third parties.

## Data Retention
- Local theme preference remains until changed, extension storage is cleared, or extension is uninstalled.

## Contact
Replace this section with your public support contact before publishing.
